title: Learn Rust
language: English
summary: "<p>This course contains small exercises aimed to familiarize you with reading\
  \ and writing Rust code. It is an adaptation of the exciting <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings\"\
  >rustlings</a> course created by Carol Nichols. The adaptation tries to stick closely\
  \ to the original spirit of rustlings but provides a few helpful hints about Rust\
  \ development added inside the IDE. It also contains materials from <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html\"\
  >The Rust Programming Language Book</a> written by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols\
  \ with contributions by the Rust Community.</p>\n<p>In this course, you will learn\
  \ about common programming concepts, such as variables, data types, functions, and\
  \ control flow and take a close look at one of Rust's essential features – ownership.\
  \ You will see examples of using strings, structs, enums, modules, and macros in\
  \ Rust and try them out yourself. Among other things, you will find out how to perform\
  \ type conversions, handle errors, and write automated tests.</p>\n<p>To work in\
  \ this course, you will need the Rust toolchain installed on your machine. The corresponding\
  \ <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html\">chapter of\
  \ The Book</a> will provide you with all the instructions on how to do that.</p>\
  \  \n<p>Have fun and good luck!</p>\n<p>P.S. Want to contribute? Feel free to send\
  \ a pull request to this course’s <a href=\"https://github.com/jetbrains-academy/rustlings-course\"\
