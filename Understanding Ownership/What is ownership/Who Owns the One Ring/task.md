## Who Owns the One Ring?

Sauron forged the One Ring for himself, 
but there were multiple owners through the times. Isildur took 
the ring after defeating Sauron, but then lost it. Déagol found it, 
but Gollum killed him and took the ring from him. 
See the rest of the story in the code. 

We want to check the ownership at three checkpoints. Comment out the 
lines with `println!` to make the ownership check results correct 
(and the code compiled!).

<div class="hint">
Remember, there should be only one owner at a time.
</div>

<div class="hint">
Rust won't let you make a mistake anyway because ownership is checked 
by the compiler. Try to cheat on it!
