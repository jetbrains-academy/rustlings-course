## Ways Variables and Data Interact: Clone

If we _do_ want to deeply copy the heap data of the `String`, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called `clone`. We’ll discuss method syntax in the [Structs](course://Structs,%20Methods,%20Enums,%20and%20Pattern%20Matching/Structs) lesson, but because methods are a common feature in many programming languages, you’ve probably seen them before.

Here’s an example of the `clone` method in action:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 3, where the heap data _does_ get copied.

When you see a call to `clone`, you know that some arbitrary code is being executed and that code may be expensive. It’s a visual indicator that something different is going on.

## Stack-Only Data: Copy

There’s another wrinkle we haven’t talked about yet. This code using integers, part of which was shown in the "Assigning the integer value of variable x to y" snippet, works and is valid:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
```

But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don’t have a call to `clone`, but `x` is still valid and wasn’t moved into `y`.

The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make. That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent `x` from being valid after we create the variable `y`. In other words, there’s no difference between deep and shallow copying here, so calling `clone` wouldn’t do anything different from the usual shallow copying and we can leave it out.

Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types like integers that are stored on the stack (we’ll talk more about traits in the [Traits](course://Generic%20Types,%20Traits,%20and%20Lifetime/Traits) lesson). If a type implements the `Copy` trait, an older variable is still usable after assignment. Rust won’t let us annotate a type with the `Copy` trait if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` trait. If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the `Copy` annotation to that type, we’ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the `Copy` annotation to your type to  implement the trait, see [“Derivable Traits”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/appendix-03-derivable-traits.html) in Appendix C.

So what types implement the `Copy` trait? You can check the documentation for the given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar values can implement `Copy`, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource can implement `Copy`. Here are some of the types that implement `Copy`:

*   All the integer types, such as `u32`.
*   The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
*   All the floating point types, such as `f64`.
*   The character type, `char`.
*   Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example, `(i32, i32)` implements `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` does not.
