## The String Type

To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more complex than the ones we covered in the [“Data Types”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types) section of the Chapter "Common Programming Concepts". The types covered previously are all stored on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, but we want to look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to clean up that data.

We’ll use `String` as the example here and concentrate on the parts of `String` that relate to ownership. These aspects also apply to other complex data types, whether they are provided by the standard library or created by you. We’ll discuss `String` in more depth in the [Strings](course://Common Collections/Strings) lesson.

We’ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our program. String literals are convenient, but they aren’t suitable for every situation in which we may want to use text. One reason is that they’re immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write our code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it? For these situations, Rust has a second string type, `String`. This type is allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time. You can create a `String` from a string literal using the `from` function, like so:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
```

The double colon (`::`) is an operator that allows us to namespace this particular `from` function under the `String` type rather than using some sort of name like `string_from`. We’ll discuss this syntax more in the [“Method Syntax”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch05-03-method-syntax.html#method-syntax) section of Chapter 5 and when we talk about namespacing with modules in [“Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html) in Chapter 7.

This kind of string _can_ be mutated:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

println!("{}", s); // This will print `hello, world!`
```

So, what’s the difference here? Why can `String` be mutated but literals cannot? The difference is how these two types deal with memory.

### Memory and Allocation

In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the text is hardcoded directly into the final executable. This is why string literals are fast and efficient. But these properties only come from the string literal’s immutability. Unfortunately, we can’t put a blob of memory into the binary for each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose size might change while running the program.

With the `String` type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. This means:

*   The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.
*   We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re done with our `String`.

That first part is done by us: when we call `String::from`, its implementation requests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming languages.

However, the second part is different. In languages with a _garbage collector (GC)_, the GC keeps track and cleans up memory that isn’t being used anymore, and we don’t need to think about it. Without a GC, it’s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and call code to explicitly return it, just as we did to request it. Doing this correctly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget, we’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one `allocate` with exactly one `free`.

Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope. Here’s a version of our scope example from the code snippet above using a `String` instead of a string literal:

```rust
{
let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward

// do stuff with s
}                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
// longer valid
```

There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our `String` needs to the allocator: when `s` goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called `drop`, and it’s where the author of `String` can put the code to return the memory. Rust calls `drop` automatically at the closing curly bracket.

> Note: In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item’s lifetime is sometimes called _Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)_. The `drop` function in Rust will be familiar to you if you’ve used RAII patterns.

This pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It may seem simple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more complicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data we’ve allocated on the heap. Let’s explore some of those situations now.
