## Borrowing Values with References

The issue with the tuple code in the previous task is that we have to return the `String` to the calling function so we can still use the `String` after the call to `calculate_length` because the `String` was moved into `calculate_length`.

Here is how you would define and use a `calculate_length` function that has a reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

First, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and the function return value is gone. Second, note that we pass `&s1` into `calculate_length` and, in its definition, we take `&String` rather than `String`.

These ampersands are _references_, and they allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it. Figure 5 shows a diagram.

> Note: The opposite of referencing by using `&` is _dereferencing_, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, `*`. We’ll see some uses of the dereference operator in Chapter 8 and discuss details of dereferencing in Chapter 15.

Let’s take a closer look at the function call here:

```rust
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);
```

The `&s1` syntax lets us create a reference that _refers_ to the value of `s1` but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference goes out of scope.

Likewise, the signature of the function uses `&` to indicate that the type of the parameter `s` is a reference. Let’s add some explanatory annotations:

```rust
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, nothing happens.
```

The scope in which the variable `s` is valid is the same as any function parameter’s scope, but we don’t drop what the reference points to when it goes out of scope because we don’t have ownership. When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won’t need to return the values in order to give back ownership because we never had ownership.

We call having references as function parameters _borrowing_. As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have to give it back.
