## The Rules of References

Let’s recap what we’ve discussed about references:

*   At any given time, you can have _either_ one mutable reference _or_ any number of immutable references.
*   References must always be valid.

Next, we’ll look at a different kind of reference: slices.

_You can refer to the following chapter in the Rust Programming Language Book: [References and Borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#references-and-borrowing)_
