## The Slice Type

Another data type that does not have ownership is the _slice_. Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.

Here’s a small programming problem: write a function that takes a string and returns the first word it finds in that string. If the function doesn’t find a space in the string, the whole string must be one word, so the entire string should be returned.

Let’s think about the signature of this function:

```rust
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> ?
```

This function, `first_word`, has a `&String` as a parameter. We don’t want ownership, so this is fine. But what should we return? We don’t really have a way to talk about _part_ of a string. However, we could return the index of the end of the word. Let’s try that, as shown in the code snippet below.

```rust
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
        let bytes = s.as_bytes();

        for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
            if item == b' ' {
                return i;
            }
        }

        s.len()
    }
```

##### The first_word function that returns a byte index value into the String parameter

Because we need to go through the `String` element by element and check whether a value is a space, we’ll convert our `String` to an array of bytes using the `as_bytes` method:

```rust
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();
```

Next, we create an iterator over the array of bytes using the `iter` method:

```rust
    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
```

We’ll discuss iterators in more detail in the [Iterators](course://Standard Library Types/Iterators) lesson. For now, know that `iter` is a method that returns each element in a collection and that `enumerate` wraps the result of `iter` and returns each element as part of a tuple instead. The first element of the tuple returned from `enumerate` is the index, and the second element is a reference to the element. This is a bit more convenient than calculating the index ourselves.

Because the `enumerate` method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to destructure that tuple, just like everywhere else in Rust. So in the `for` loop, we specify a pattern that has `i` for the index in the tuple and `&item` for the single byte in the tuple. Because we get a reference to the element from `.iter().enumerate()`, we use `&` in the pattern.

Inside the `for` loop, we search for the byte that represents the space by using the byte literal syntax. If we find a space, we return the position. Otherwise, we return the length of the string by using `s.len()`:

```rust
        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()
```

We now have a way to find out the index of the end of the first word in the string, but there’s a problem. We’re returning a `usize` on its own, but it’s only a meaningful number in the context of the `&String`. In other words, because it’s a separate value from the `String`, there’s no guarantee that it will still be valid in the future. Consider the program in the code snippet below that uses the `first_word` function from the previous example.

```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello world");

        let word = first_word(&s); // word will get the value 5

        s.clear(); // this empties the String, making it equal to ""

        // word still has the value 5 here, but there's no more string that
        // we could meaningfully use the value 5 with. word is now totally invalid!
    }
```

##### Storing the result from calling the first_word function and then changing the String contents

This program compiles without any errors and would also do so if we used `word` after calling `s.clear()`. Because `word` isn’t connected to the state of `s` at all, `word` still contains the value `5`. We could use that value `5` with the variable `s` to try to extract the first word out, but this would be a bug because the contents of `s` have changed since we saved `5` in `word`.

Having to worry about the index in `word` getting out of sync with the data in `s` is tedious and error-prone! Managing these indices is even more brittle if we write a `second_word` function. Its signature would have to look like this:

```rust
    fn second_word(s: &String) -> (usize, usize) {
```

Now we’re tracking a starting _and_ an ending index, and we have even more values that were calculated from data in a particular state but aren’t tied to that state at all. We now have three unrelated variables floating around that need to be kept in sync.

Luckily, Rust has a solution to this problem: string slices.
