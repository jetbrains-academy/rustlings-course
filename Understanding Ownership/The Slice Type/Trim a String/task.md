## Trim a String

We have an implementation of the `trimmed_space` function which returns a string slice without leading and trailing spaces. Unfortunately, some fragments are missing and compiler reports errors. Fix all the errors. Remember, the function should work both with `String` slices and string literals.

Once you are done fixing, try to come up with a much better implementation of this function.
Maybe you can find something in the standard library.

The right type for an argument and a result is <code>&str</code>.

<div class="hint">
What are the borders of the slice you return? Are they inclusive or not?
</div>
