## License It

Your task is to implement the `Licensed` trait for
both structures and have them return the same
information (namely, the text `Some information`) without implementing the same function twice.

Consider what you can add to the `Licensed` trait.


<div class="hint">
Traits can have a default implementation for functions. Structs that implement
the trait can then use the default version of these functions if they choose not
to implement the function themselves.
