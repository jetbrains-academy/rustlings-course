### Calling Methods Without Default Implementations

Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even if those
other methods don’t have a default implementation. In this way, a trait can
provide a lot of useful functionality and only require implementors to specify
a small part of it. For example, we could define the `Summary` trait to have a
`summarize_author` method whose implementation is required, and then define a
`summarize` method that has a default implementation that calls the
`summarize_author` method:

```rust,noplayground
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;

    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
    }
}
```

To use this version of `Summary`, we only need to define `summarize_author`
when we implement the trait on a type:

```rust,ignore
impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
        format!("@{}", self.username)
    }
}
```

After we define `summarize_author`, we can call `summarize` on instances of the
`Tweet` struct, and the default implementation of `summarize` will call the
definition of `summarize_author` that we’ve provided. Because we’ve implemented
`summarize_author`, the `Summary` trait has given us the behavior of the
`summarize` method without requiring us to write any more code.

```rust,ignore
let tweet = Tweet {
    username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
    content: String::from(
        "of course, as you probably already know, people",
    ),
    reply: false,
    retweet: false,
};

println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
```

This code prints `1 new tweet: (Read more from @horse_ebooks...)`.

Note that it isn’t possible to call the default implementation from an
overriding implementation of that same method.
