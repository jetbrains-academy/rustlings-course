## Traits: Defining Shared Behavior

A *trait* tells the Rust compiler about functionality a particular type has and
can share with other types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an
abstract way. We can use trait bounds to specify that a generic can be any type
that has certain behavior.

> Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called *interfaces* in other
> languages, although with some differences.
