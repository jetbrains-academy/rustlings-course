### Using Trait Bounds to Conditionally Implement Methods

By using a trait bound with an `impl` block that uses generic type parameters,
we can implement methods conditionally for types that implement the specified
traits. For example, the type `Pair<T>` in the listing below always implements the
`new` function. But `Pair<T>` only implements the `cmp_display` method if its
inner type `T` implements the `PartialOrd` trait that enables comparison *and*
the `Display` trait that enables printing.


```rust,noplayground
use std::fmt::Display;

struct Pair<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Pair<T> {
    fn new(x: T, y: T) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }
}

impl<T: Display + PartialOrd> Pair<T> {
    fn cmp_display(&self) {
        if self.x >= self.y {
            println!("The largest member is x = {}", self.x);
        } else {
            println!("The largest member is y = {}", self.y);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Conditionally implement methods on a generic type depending on trait bounds

We can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that implements
another trait. Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait
bounds are called *blanket implementations* and are extensively used in the
Rust standard library. For example, the standard library implements the
`ToString` trait on any type that implements the `Display` trait. The `impl`
block in the standard library looks similar to this code:

```rust,ignore
impl<T: Display> ToString for T {
    // --snip--
}
```

Because the standard library has this blanket implementation, we can call the
`to_string` method defined by the `ToString` trait on any type that implements
the `Display` trait. For example, we can turn integers into their corresponding
`String` values like this because integers implement `Display`:

```rust
let s = 3.to_string();
```

Blanket implementations appear in the documentation for the trait in the
“Implementors” section.

Traits and trait bounds let us write code that uses generic type parameters to
reduce duplication but also specify to the compiler that we want the generic
type to have particular behavior. The compiler can then use the trait bound
information to check that all the concrete types used with our code provide the
correct behavior. In dynamically typed languages, we would get an error at
runtime if we called a method on a type which didn’t define the method. But Rust
moves these errors to compile time, so we’re forced to fix the problems before
our code is even able to run. Additionally, we don’t have to write code that
checks for behavior at runtime because we’ve already checked at compile time.
Doing so improves performance without having to give up the flexibility of
generics.
