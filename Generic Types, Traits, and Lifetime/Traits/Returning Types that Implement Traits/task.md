### Returning Types that Implement Traits

We can also use the `impl Trait` syntax in the return position to return a
value of some type that implements a trait, as shown here:

```rust,ignore
fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
    Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    }
}
```

By using `impl Summary` for the return type, we specify that the
`returns_summarizable` function returns some type that implements the `Summary`
trait without naming the concrete type. In this case, `returns_summarizable`
returns a `Tweet`, but the code calling this function doesn’t know that.

The ability to return a type that is only specified by the trait it implements
is especially useful in the context of closures and iterators.
It will be covered in details in the [Standard Library Types](course://Standard Library Types) section.
Closures and iterators create types that only the compiler knows
or types that are very long to specify. The `impl Trait` syntax lets you
concisely specify that a function returns some type that implements the
`Iterator` trait without needing to write out a very long type.

However, you can only use `impl Trait` if you’re returning a single type. For
example, this code that returns either a `NewsArticle` or a `Tweet` with the
return type specified as `impl Summary` wouldn’t work:

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
fn returns_summarizable(switch: bool) -> impl Summary {
    if switch {
        NewsArticle {
            headline: String::from(
                "Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!",
            ),
            location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
            author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
            content: String::from(
                "The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \
                 hockey team in the NHL.",
            ),
        }
    } else {
        Tweet {
            username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
            content: String::from(
                "of course, as you probably already know, people",
            ),
            reply: false,
            retweet: false,
        }
    }
}
```

Returning either a `NewsArticle` or a `Tweet` isn’t allowed due to restrictions
around how the `impl Trait` syntax is implemented in the compiler. We’ll cover
how to write a function with this behavior in the [“Using Trait Objects That
Allow for Values of Different
Types”][using-trait-objects-that-allow-for-values-of-different-types]<!--
ignore --> section of Chapter 17 of the Rust Book.
