### In Method Definitions

We can implement methods on structs and enums (as we did in the [Structs](course://Structs,%20Methods,%20Enums,%20and%20Pattern%20Matching/Structs) lesson) and use
generic types in their definitions, too. The code snippet below shows the `Point<T>`
struct we defined above with a method named `x` implemented on it.


```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```

#### Implementing a method named `x` on the `Point<T>` struct that will return a reference to the `x` field of type `T`.

Here, we’ve defined a method named `x` on `Point<T>` that returns a reference
to the data in the field `x`.

Note that we have to declare `T` just after `impl` so we can use it to specify
that we’re implementing methods on the type `Point<T>`.  By declaring `T` as a
generic type after `impl`, Rust can identify that the type in the angle
brackets in `Point` is a generic type rather than a concrete type.

We could, for example, implement methods only on `Point<f32>` instances rather
than on `Point<T>` instances with any generic type. Below we use the
concrete type `f32`, meaning we don’t declare any types after `impl`.


```rust
impl Point<f32> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}
```

#### An `impl` block that only applies to a struct with a particular concrete type for the generic type parameter `T`.

This code means the type `Point<f32>` will have a method named
`distance_from_origin` and other instances of `Point<T>` where `T` is not of
type `f32` will not have this method defined. The method measures how far our
point is from the point at coordinates (0.0, 0.0) and uses mathematical
operations that are available only for floating-point types.
