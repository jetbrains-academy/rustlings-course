### Making Structs and Enums Public

We can also use `pub` to designate structs and enums as public, but there are a few extra details. If we use `pub` before a struct definition, we make the struct public, but the struct’s fields will still be private. We can make each field public or not on a case-by-case basis. In the example below, we’ve defined a public `back_of_house::Breakfast` struct with a public `toast` field but a private `seasonal_fruit` field. This models the case in a restaurant where the customer can pick the type of bread that comes with a meal, but the chef decides which fruit accompanies the meal based on what’s in season and in stock. The available fruit changes quickly, so customers can’t choose the fruit or even see which fruit they’ll get.

```rust
    mod back_of_house {
        pub struct Breakfast {
            pub toast: String,
            seasonal_fruit: String,
        }

        impl Breakfast {
            pub fn summer(toast: &str) -> Breakfast {
                Breakfast {
                    toast: String::from(toast),
                    seasonal_fruit: String::from("peaches"),
                }
            }
        }
    }

    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        // Order a breakfast in the summer with Rye toast
        let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer("Rye");
        // Change our mind about what bread we'd like
        meal.toast = String::from("Wheat");
        println!("I'd like {} toast please", meal.toast);

        // The next line won't compile if we uncomment it; we're not allowed
        // to see or modify the seasonal fruit that comes with the meal
        // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from("blueberries");
    }
```

##### A struct with some public fields and some private fields

Because the `toast` field in the `back_of_house::Breakfast` struct is public, in `eat_at_restaurant` we can read and write to the `toast` field using dot notation. Notice that we can’t use the `seasonal_fruit` field in `eat_at_restaurant` because `seasonal_fruit` is private. Try uncommenting the line modifying the `seasonal_fruit` field value to see what error you get!

Also, note that because `back_of_house::Breakfast` has a private field, the struct needs to provide a public associated function that constructs an instance of `Breakfast` (we’ve named it `summer` here). If `Breakfast` didn’t have such a function, we couldn’t create an instance of `Breakfast` in `eat_at_restaurant` because we couldn’t set the value of the private `seasonal_fruit` field in `eat_at_restaurant`.

In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then public. We only need the `pub` before the `enum` keyword, as shown below.

```rust
    mod back_of_house {
        pub enum Appetizer {
            Soup,
            Salad,
        }
    }

    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
        let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
    }
```

##### Designating an enum as public makes all its variants public

Because we made the `Appetizer` enum public, we can use the `Soup` and `Salad` variants in `eat_at_restaurant`. Enums aren’t very useful unless their variants are public; it would be annoying to have to annotate all enum variants with `pub` in every case, so the default for enum variants is to be public. Structs are often useful without their fields being public, so struct fields follow the general rule of everything being private by default unless annotated with `pub`.

There’s one more situation involving `pub` that we haven’t covered, and that is our last module system feature: the `use` keyword. We’ll cover `use` by itself first, and then we’ll show how to combine `pub` and `use`.
