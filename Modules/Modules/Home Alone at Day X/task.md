## Home Alone at Day X

Here we find a small girl Alice alone in a large house. The house is enormous. It has three floors and plenty of rooms.

It's Day X, nothing serious, just an ordinary day for Alice. She starts her day, as usual, playing with her toys. Your first task is to make sure that Alice has access to them.

For the second task, you have to help Alice to explore the house, find a telescope, and then look at the stars. There are functions for that. Call them right after playing with the toys.

You should find the path to the module with <code>fn i_love_toys</code> and then write the corresponding <code>use</code> statement. In fact, %IDE_NAME% can do everything for you. Just ask.
