### Capturing References or Moving Ownership

Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways, which directly map to the three ways a function can take a parameter: borrowing immutably, borrowing mutably, and taking ownership. The closure will decide which of these to use based on what the body of the function does with the captured values.

The following Listing defines a closure that captures an immutable borrow to the vector named `list` because it only needs an immutable borrow to print the value. This example also illustrates that a variable can bind to a closure definition, and the closure can later be called by using the variable name and parentheses as if the variable name were a function name:

```rust
fn main() {
    let list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);

    let only_borrows = || println!("From closure: {:?}", list);

    println!("Before calling closure: {:?}", list);
    only_borrows();
    println!("After calling closure: {:?}", list);
}
```

##### Example of defining and calling a closure that captures an immutable borrow

The `list` is still accessible by the code before the closure definition, after the closure definition but before the closure is called, and after the closure is called because we can have multiple immutable borrows of `list` at the same time. This code compiles, runs, and prints:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling closure-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/closure-example)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.43s
     Running `target/debug/closure-example`
Before defining closure: [1, 2, 3]
Before calling closure: [1, 2, 3]
From closure: [1, 2, 3]
After calling closure: [1, 2, 3]
```

The next Listing changes the closure definition to need a mutable borrow because the closure body adds an element to the `list` vector:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut list = vec![1, 2, 3];
    println!("Before defining closure: {:?}", list);

    let mut borrows_mutably = || list.push(7);

    borrows_mutably();
    println!("After calling closure: {:?}", list);
}
```

##### Example of defining and calling a closure that captures a mutable borrow

This code compiles, runs, and prints:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling closure-example v0.1.0 (file:///projects/closure-example)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.43s
     Running `target/debug/closure-example`
Before defining closure: [1, 2, 3]
After calling closure: [1, 2, 3, 7]
```

Note that there’s no longer a `println!` between the definition and the call of the `borrows_mutably` closure: when `borrows_mutably` is defined, it captures a mutable reference to `list`. After the closure is called, because we don’t use the closure again after that point, the mutable borrow ends. Between the closure definition and the closure call, an immutable borrow to print isn’t allowed because no other borrows are allowed when there’s a mutable borrow. Try adding a `println!` there to see what error message you get!

If you want to force the closure to take ownership of the values it uses in the environment even though the body of the closure doesn’t strictly need ownership, you can use the `move` keyword before the parameter list. This technique is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new thread to move the data so it’s owned by the new thread. We’ll have more examples of `move` closures in the [Fearless Concurrency](course://Fearless Concurrency) section when we talk about concurrency.
