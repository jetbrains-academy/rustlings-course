## Destructure a Tuple

Destructure the `cat` tuple so that the println will work.

<div class="hint">

  Take a look at the [previous task](Common Programming Concepts/Tuples and Arrays/The Tuple Type). Particularly the part about destructuring (second to last example).

  You'll need to make a pattern to bind `name` and `age` to the appropriate parts of the tuple. You can do it!!
