## Use a Tuple Index

Use a tuple index to access the second element of `numbers`.

You can put this right into the `println!`.

<div class="hint">

  While you could use a destructuring <code>let</code> for the tuple here, try indexing into it instead, as explained in the last example of [The Tuple Type](course://Common Programming Concepts/Tuples and Arrays/The Tuple Type).

  Now you have another tool in your toolbox!
