## Variable Type

Make me compile!

<div class="hint">
  The compiler message is saying that Rust cannot infer the type that the variable binding <code>x</code> has with what is given here.

  What happens if you annotate line 2 with a type annotation?

  What if you give `x` a value?

  What if you do both?

  What type should `x` be, anyway?

  What if `x` is the same type as 10? What if it's a different type?
