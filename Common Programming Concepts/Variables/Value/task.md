## Give a Value

Make me compile!

<div class="hint">
  Oops! In this exercise, we have a variable binding that we've created on line 2, and we're trying to use it on line 3, but we haven't given it a value.

  We can't print out something that isn't there; try giving `x` a value!
  This is an error that can cause bugs that's very easy to make in any programming language — thankfully the Rust compiler has caught this for us!
