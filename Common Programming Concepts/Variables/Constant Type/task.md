<div class="hint">
  We know about variables and mutability, but there is another important type of
variable available; constants.

<div class="hint">

Constants are always immutable and are declared using the <code>const</code> keyword instead of <code>let</code>. 
Additionally, the types of constants must always be annotated. Weâ€™ll dive deeper into type annotations in the [Basic Data Types](course://Common Programming Concepts/Basic Data Types) lesson. For now, you can use the `i32` type for a signed 32-bit integer.
