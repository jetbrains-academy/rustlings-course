## Constant Type

Make me compile!

<div class="hint">
  We know about variables and mutability, but there is another important type of
variable available; constants.
</div>

<div class="hint">

Constants are always immutable and they are declared with keyword <code>const</code> rather
than keyword <code>let</code>.
Constants types must also always be annotated. We'll go into the details of the type annotations in the [Basic Data Types](course://Common Programming Concepts/Basic Data Types) lesson. For now, you can use `i32` type for signed 32-bit integer.
