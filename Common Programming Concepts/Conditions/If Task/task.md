## Return the Bigger Number

Complete this function to return the bigger number!

Do not use:

* `return`
* another function call
* additional variables

<div class="hint">
  It's possible to do this in one line if you would like!

  Some similar examples from other languages:
  - In C(++) this would be: `a > b ? a : b`
  - In Python this would be:  `a if a > b else b`
</div>
<div class="hint">
  Remember in Rust that:

  * the <code>if</code> condition does not need to be surrounded by parentheses
  * <code>if</code> / <code>else</code> conditionals are expressions
  * Each condition is followed by a <code>{}</code> block.
