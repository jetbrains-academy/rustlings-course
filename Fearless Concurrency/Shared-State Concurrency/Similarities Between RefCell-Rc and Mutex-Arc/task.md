### Similarities Between RefCell&lt;T>/Rc&lt;T> and Mutex&lt;T>/Arc&lt;T>

You might have noticed that `counter` is immutable but we could get a mutable reference to the value inside it; this means `Mutex<T>` provides interior mutability, as the `Cell` family does. In the same way we used `RefCell<T>` in Chapter 15 to allow us to mutate contents inside an `Rc<T>`, we use `Mutex<T>` to mutate contents inside an `Arc<T>`.

Another detail to note is that Rust can’t protect you from all kinds of logic errors when you use `Mutex<T>`. Recall in Chapter 15 that using `Rc<T>` came with the risk of creating reference cycles, where two `Rc<T>` values refer to each other, causing memory leaks. Similarly, `Mutex<T>` comes with the risk of creating _deadlocks_. These occur when an operation needs to lock two resources and two threads have each acquired one of the locks, causing them to wait for each other forever. If you’re interested in deadlocks, try creating a Rust program that has a deadlock; then research deadlock mitigation strategies for mutexes in any language and have a go at implementing them in Rust. The standard library API documentation for `Mutex<T>` and `MutexGuard` offers useful information.

You can also read the [book section about the `Send` and `Sync` traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch16-04-extensible-concurrency-sync-and-send.html)
and see how we can use them with custom types.
