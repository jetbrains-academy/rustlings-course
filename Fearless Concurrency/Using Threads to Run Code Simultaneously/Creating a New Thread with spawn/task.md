### Creating a New Thread with `spawn`

To create a new thread, we call the `thread::spawn` function and pass it a closure (we talked about closures in the [Closures](course://Standard Library Types/Closures) lesson) containing the code we want to run in the new thread. The example in the code snippet below prints some text from a main thread and other text from a new thread:

```rust
    use std::thread;
    use std::time::Duration;

    fn main() {
        thread::spawn(|| {
            for i in 1..10 {
                println!("hi number {} from the spawned thread!", i);
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
            }
        });

        for i in 1..5 {
            println!("hi number {} from the main thread!", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    }
```

##### Creating a new thread to print one thing while the main thread prints something else

Note that with this function, the new thread will be stopped when the main thread ends, whether or not it has finished running. The output from this program might be a little different every time, but it will look similar to the following:

```text
    hi number 1 from the main thread!
    hi number 1 from the spawned thread!
    hi number 2 from the main thread!
    hi number 2 from the spawned thread!
    hi number 3 from the main thread!
    hi number 3 from the spawned thread!
    hi number 4 from the main thread!
    hi number 4 from the spawned thread!
    hi number 5 from the spawned thread!
```

The calls to `thread::sleep` force a thread to stop its execution for a short duration, allowing a different thread to run. The threads will probably take turns, but that isn’t guaranteed: it depends on how your operating system schedules the threads. In this run, the main thread printed first, even though the print statement from the spawned thread appears first in the code. And even though we told the spawned thread to print until `i` is 9, it only got to 5 before the main thread shut down.

If you run this code and only see output from the main thread, or don’t see any overlap, try increasing the numbers in the ranges to create more opportunities for the operating system to switch between the threads.
