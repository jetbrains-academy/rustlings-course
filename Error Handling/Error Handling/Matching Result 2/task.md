## Extended Matching Result

This is a program that is trying to use a completed version of the `total_cost` function from the previous exercise.
It's not working though -- we can't use the `?` operator in the `main()` function! Why not?

<div class="hint">
If other functions can return a <code>Result</code>, why shouldn't <code>main</code>?
</div>
