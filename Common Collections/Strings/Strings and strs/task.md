## Strings and &strs
Ok, here are a bunch of values – some are `Strings`, some are `&strs`.
Your task is to call one of these two functions on each value depending on what you think each value is.
That is, add either `string_slice` or `string` before the parentheses on each line.
If you're right, it will compile!
