## String Slice

Make me compile without changing the function signature!

<div class="hint">
  Yes, it would be really easy to fix this by just changing the value bound to <code>word</code> to be a string slice instead of a <code>String</code>, wouldn't it?

  There is a way to add one character to line 3, though, that will coerce the `String` into a string slice.
