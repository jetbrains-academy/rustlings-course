## Create a Vector on Your Own

Your task is to create a `Vec` which holds the exact same elements as in the array `a`.

Make the code compile and pass the test!

<div class="hint">In Rust, there are two ways to define a Vector.

One way is to use the `Vec::new()` function to create a new vector
  and fill it with the `push()` method.
</div></li>

<div class="hint">The second way, which is simpler is to use the <code>vec![]</code> macro and
  define your elements inside the square brackets.</div></li>
