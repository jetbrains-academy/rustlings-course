### Updating a Vector

To create a vector and then add elements to it, we can use the `push` method,
as shown in the code snippet below.

```rust
    let mut v = Vec::new();

    v.push(5);
    v.push(6);
    v.push(7);
    v.push(8);
```

#### Using the `push` method to add values to a vector

As with any variable, if we want to be able to change its value, we need to
make it mutable using the `mut` keyword, as discussed in the [Common Programming Concepts](course://Common Programming Concepts) section. The numbers
we place inside are all of type `i32`, and Rust infers this from the data, so
we donâ€™t need the `Vec<i32>` annotation.
