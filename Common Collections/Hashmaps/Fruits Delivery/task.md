## Fruits Delivery

A basket of fruits in the form of a hash map needs to be defined.
The key represents the name of the fruit and the value represents
how many of that particular fruit is in the basket. You have to put
at least three different types of fruits (e.g apple, banana, mango)
in the basket and the total count of all the fruits should be at
least five.

Make your code compile and pass the tests!

<div class="hint"> Take a look at the return type of the function to figure out
  the type for the <code>basket</code>.</div></li>

<div class="hint">Number of fruits should be at least 5. And you have to put
  at least three different types of fruits.</div></li>
