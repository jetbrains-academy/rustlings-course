## More Fruits

A basket of fruits in the form of a hash map is given. The key
represents the name of the fruit and the value represents how many
of that particular fruit is in the basket. You have to put *MORE
THAN 11* fruits in the basket. Three types of fruits - Apple (4),
Mango (2) and Lichi (5) are already given in the basket. You are
not allowed to insert any more of these fruits!

Make your code pass the tests!

<div class="hint"> Use the <code>entry()</code> and  <code>or_insert()</code> methods of <code>HashMap</code> to achieve this.</div>
