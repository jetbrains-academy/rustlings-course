## Summary

Structs let you create custom types that are meaningful for your domain. By
using structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other
and name each piece to make your code clear. Methods let you specify the
behavior that instances of your structs have, and associated functions let you
namespace functionality that is particular to your struct without having an
instance available.

But structs aren’t the only way you can create custom types: let’s turn to
Rust’s enum feature to add another tool to your toolbox.
