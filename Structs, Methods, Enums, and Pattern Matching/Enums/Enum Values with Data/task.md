### Enum Values with Data

Using enums has even more advantages. Thinking more about our IP address type,
at the moment we don’t have a way to store the actual IP address *data*; we
only know what *kind* it is. Given that you just learned about structs in
the previous chapter, you might tackle this problem as shown in the code snippet below.

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}

struct IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind,
    address: String,
}

let home = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
    address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
};

let loopback = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
    address: String::from("::1"),
};
```

#### Storing the data and `IpAddrKind` variant of an IP address using a `struct`

Here, we’ve defined a struct `IpAddr` that has two fields: a `kind` field that
is of type `IpAddrKind` (the enum we defined previously) and an `address` field
of type `String`. We have two instances of this struct. The first, `home`, has
the value `IpAddrKind::V4` as its `kind` with associated address data of
`127.0.0.1`. The second instance, `loopback`, has the other variant of
`IpAddrKind` as its `kind` value, `V6`, and has address `::1` associated with
it. We’ve used a struct to bundle the `kind` and `address` values together, so
now the variant is associated with the value.

We can represent the same concept in a more concise way using just an enum,
rather than an enum inside a struct, by putting data directly into each enum
variant. This new definition of the `IpAddr` enum says that both `V4` and `V6`
variants will have associated `String` values:

```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

We attach data to each variant of the enum directly, so there is no need for an
extra struct.
