### Matches Are Exhaustive

There’s one other aspect of `match` we need to discuss. Consider this version
of our `plus_one` function that has a bug and won’t compile:

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}
```

We didn’t handle the `None` case, so this code will cause a bug. Luckily, it’s
a bug Rust knows how to catch. If we try to compile this code, we’ll get this
error:

```console
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `None` not covered
   --> src/main.rs:3:15
    |
3   |         match x {
    |               ^ pattern `None` not covered
    |
    = help: ensure that all possible cases are being handled, possibly by adding wildcards or more match arms
    = note: the matched value is of type `Option<i32>`
```

Rust knows that we didn’t cover every possible case and even knows which
pattern we forgot! Matches in Rust are *exhaustive*: we must exhaust every last
possibility in order for the code to be valid. Especially in the case of
`Option<T>`, when Rust prevents us from forgetting to explicitly handle the
`None` case, it protects us from assuming that we have a value when we might
have null, thus making the billion-dollar mistake discussed earlier impossible.
