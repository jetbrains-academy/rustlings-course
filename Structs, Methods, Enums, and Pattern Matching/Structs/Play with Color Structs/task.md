## Play with Color Structs

Complete all TODO fields to make the tests pass!
You should define a Classic Struct with two fields: `name` and `hex` and then create an instance of this struct with values **"green"** and **"#00FF00"** corresponding to these fields.
You should also define a Tuple Struct with two string-type fields and instantiate one with the same values as before.

<div class="hint">
If you are in trouble look for examples in this lesson. You will need both regular structs with named fields and tuple structs.
