Greetings and welcome to `Learn Rust`.
This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.
This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

## Credits
The materials are based on the original course [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) created by [Carol Nichols](https://github.com/carols10cents)! The course is provided with the materials from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) book, written by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community.
