Welcome to the JetBrains Academy adaptation of the exciting [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) course.

This course contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

The original materials were written by [Carol Nichols](https://github.com/carols10cents). This adaptation tries to stick closely to the initial spirit of rustlings, but with a few helpful hints about Rust development added inside the IDE.

Alternatively, for a first-time Rust learner, there are several other resources:
* [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) – the most comprehensive resource for learning Rust, by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community. All along the course, you will be provided with links to the relevant chapters describing the concepts discussed in a more fundamental manner.

* [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) – an online collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries.
